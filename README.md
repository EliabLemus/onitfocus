# ⏳ Focally

**Focus sessions, managed.**

A minimal macOS menu bar app that handles Do Not Disturb, Slack status, and timer — so you can focus on what matters.

## Why Focally?

We looked at every focus app out there. None did what we needed:

- **Timing apps** (Pomodone, Session) — no DND, no Slack sync
- **Menu bar timers** (Thyme, Hour) — no status integration
- **Productivity suites** (RescueTime, Forest) — heavy, expensive, opinionated

Focally is one thing: **start a timer, get in the zone, let the app handle the rest.** No subscriptions, no bloat, no cloud dependency.

## How it works

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Start** | Pick an activity + duration → timer begins |
| **Focus** | DND activates, Slack status updates automatically |
| **Finish** | Bell rings, notification fires, DND deactivates |

### Controls

- **Left-click** ⏳ → focus panel (start, countdown, extend, end)
- **Right-click** ⏳ → context menu (settings, quit)

## Permissions

| Permission | Why | How |
|---|---|---|
| Accessibility | Toggle Do Not Disturb | System Settings → Privacy → Accessibility → Add Focally |
| Notifications | Session alerts | System Settings → Notifications → Focally → Allow |
